# To do

Open work only. What's done is in `CHANGELOG.md`, the panel and money reviews
from October 2026 are in `docs/PANEL-2026-10.md`, and the pilots are in
`docs/PILOT.md`. Nothing is declined: every idea from a review, a pilot or the
owner is built, and anything that touches privacy or safety is built as an
opt-in setting or policy with the safe default kept.

## Building next

1. A due date for a plan, with the reminder on that day, for work run by
   deadlines such as invoices (Rafael, round 66 pilot).
2. Save my plans to a file as a spreadsheet file too, which opens in Excel
   (Rafael).
3. A short "welcome back" line when the window opens after missed workdays,
   with nothing that counts what was missed (Priya).
4. A button that deletes the exported plans file, next to the note in Delete
   everything that it is still there (Mónica).
5. Check the pilot tool's text menu with the same stand-ins as its window
   before the next pilot: the round 66 run of it reached the real Task
   Scheduler, the user's `HKCU\Software\Classes` and Documents folder.

## Needs the deploying organization

1. Sign the package with the organization's code-signing certificate:
   `tools\build-package.ps1 -CertificateThumbprint <thumbprint> -TimestampServer <URL>`.
   CI already proves a signed package installs under AllSigned.
2. A real pilot with employees. `docs/PILOT.md` has the simulated ones.

## Checked and already fine

Review findings that turned out wrong or already handled, kept so they aren't
re-checked:
- The OS error text in the stderr message is what someone debugging a dead
  stdout needs.
- `GENERIC_WRITE` in `Assert-AdminOnly` is bit 30 and positive as an int32,
  and testing showed every write grant refused.
- `VERSION` drives the auto-tag workflow, so the installer keeps it.
- An uppercase `-Commit` already works.
- The exit code already passes through `hello.cmd`.
- `uninstall.ps1` already restarts itself elevated.
- `$ProgressPreference` is set in the script's own scope.
- The window a timed reminder opens with `DETACHED_PROCESS` outlives the
  scheduled task's time limit; the owner checked it with a throwaway task.
- Unknown keys in `notes.json`, the Dependabot check, and the data folder's
  access list were already handled in Round 43.
